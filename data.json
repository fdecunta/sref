However, existing visualization methods in meta-analysis have predominantly focused on quantitative aspects, such as forest plots and funnel plots, thereby neglecting qualitative information that is equally important for end-users in science, policy, and practice. We introduce a framework consisting of a series of visualization toolkits designed to enrich meta-analyses by borrowing approaches from other research synthesis methods, including systematic evidence mapping (scoping reviews), bibliometrics (bibliometric analysis), and alternative impact metric analysis. These “enrichment” toolkits aim to facilitate the synthesis of both quantitative and qualitative evidence, along with the assessment of the academic and nonacademic influences of the meta-analytic evidence base. While the meta-analysis yields quantitative insights, the enrichment analyses, and visualizations provide user-friendly summaries of qualitative information on the evidence base. For example, a systematic evidence map can visualize study characteristics, unraveling knowledge gaps and methodological differences. Bibliometric analysis offers a visual assessment of the nonindependent evidence, such as hyper-dominant authors and countries, and funding sources, potentially informing the risk of bias. Alternative impact metric analysis employs alternative metrics to gauge societal influence and research translation (e.g., policy and patent citations) of studies in the meta-analysis. We provide a dedicated webpage showcasing sample visualizations and providing step-by-step implementation in open-source software R (\u003cjats:uri xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"https://yefeng0920.github.io/MA_Map_Bib/\"\u003ehttps://yefeng0920.github.io/MA_Map_Bib/\u003c/jats:uri\u003e). Additionally, we offer a guide on leveraging three commercially free large language models (LLMs) to help adapt the sample script, enabling users with less R coding experience to visualize their own meta-analytic evidence base.\u003c/jats:p\u003e"

Temperature is identified as the dominant abiotic factor directly affecting herbivorous insects. There is little evidence of any direct effects of CO\u003cjats:sub\u003e2\u003c/jats:sub\u003e or UVB. Direct impacts of precipitation have been largely neglected in current research on climate change. Temperature directly affects development, survival, range and abundance. Species with a large geographical range will tend to be less affected. The main effect of temperature in temperate regions is to influence winter survival; at more northerly latitudes, higher temperatures extend the summer season, increasing the available thermal budget for growth and reproduction. Photoperiod is the dominant cue for the seasonal synchrony of temperate insects, but their thermal requirements may differ at different times of year. Interactions between photoperiod and temperature determine phenology; the two factors do not necessarily operate in tandem. Insect herbivores show a number of distinct life‐history strategies to exploit plants with different growth forms and strategies, which will be differentially affected by climate warming. There are still many challenges facing biologists in predicting and monitoring the impacts of climate change. Future research needs to consider insect herbivore phenotypic and genotypic flexibility, their responses to global change parameters operating in concert, and awareness that some patterns may only become apparent in the longer term.\u003c/jats:p\u003e"

However, it is unknown whether there are any common patterns of change in leaf trait expression in response to neighbourhood diversity, and whether these responses confer increased resistance or susceptibility to herbivores.\u003c/jats:p\u003e\u003c/jats:list-item\u003e\n\n\u003cjats:list-item\u003e\u003cjats:p\u003eWe used meta‐analysis to combine data from 43 studies that examined the influence of neighbourhood diversity on eight physical and chemical leaf traits that could affect herbivory. All leaf traits apart from leaf thickness were highly plastic and exhibited significant differences between plant monocultures and species mixtures, but the direction of effect was variable. Leaf toughness was the only trait that displayed a significant decrease with plant diversity, whereas specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf nitrogen were both marginally increased in species mixtures.\u003c/jats:p\u003e\u003c/jats:list-item\u003e\n\n\u003cjats:list-item\u003e\u003cjats:p\u003eThe magnitude and direction of leaf trait responses to neighbourhood diversity were independent of plant density and phylogenetic diversity, but changes in SLA correlated positively with plant species richness. SLA was also significantly increased in experimental studies, but not in observational studies, while neighbourhoods containing nitrogen‐fixers were associated with increased leaf nitrogen and reduced phenolics. When studies on the over‐represented species \u003cjats:italic\u003eBetula pendula\u003c/jats:italic\u003e were removed from the analysis, the effect of neighbourhood diversity on leaf toughness became nonsignificant, but phenolics were significantly reduced in diverse neighbourhoods composed of mature trees, and marginally reduced in species mixtures across all studies.\u003c/jats:p\u003e\u003c/jats:list-item\u003e\n\n\u003cjats:list-item\u003e\u003cjats:p\u003eIncreases in plant neighbourhood diversity are often associated with reductions of herbivory, although in some cases, the reverse occurs, and plants growing in species mixtures are found to suffer greater herbivory than those in monocultures. This study offers a potential explanation for the latter phenomenon, as our results show that leaf trait expression is highly plastic in response to neighbourhood diversity, and in certain cases could lead to increased leaf quality, which in turn could promote greater rates of herbivory.\u003c/jats:p\u003e\u003c/jats:list-item\u003e\n\u003c/jats:list\u003e\n\u003c/jats:p\u003e\u003cjats:p\u003eRead the free \u003cjats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2023/10/03/does-trait-variation-cause-a-reduction-of-leaf-quality-for-plants-growing-in-species-mixtures/\"\u003ePlain Language Summary\u003c/jats:ext-link\u003e for this article on the Journal blog.\u003c/jats:p\u003e"

Unfortunately, methods to test for the presence of publication bias, or assess its impact on meta‐analytic results, are unsuitable for datasets with high heterogeneity and non‐independence, as is common in ecology and evolutionary biology.\u003c/jats:p\u003e\u003c/jats:list-item\u003e\n\n\u003cjats:list-item\u003e\u003cjats:p\u003eWe first review both classic and emerging publication bias tests (e.g. funnel plots, Egger's regression, cumulative meta‐analysis, fail‐safe \u003cjats:italic\u003eN\u003c/jats:italic\u003e, trim‐and‐fill tests, \u003cjats:italic\u003ep\u003c/jats:italic\u003e‐curve and selection models), showing that some tests cannot handle heterogeneity, and, more importantly, none of the methods can deal with non‐independence. For each method, we estimate current usage in ecology and evolutionary biology, based on a representative sample of 102 meta‐analyses published in the last 10 years.\u003c/jats:p\u003e\u003c/jats:list-item\u003e\n\n\u003cjats:list-item\u003e\u003cjats:p\u003eThen, we propose a new method using multilevel meta‐regression, which can model both heterogeneity and non‐independence, by extending existing regression‐based methods (i.e. Egger's regression). We describe how our multilevel meta‐regression can test not only publication bias, but also time‐lag bias, and how it can be supplemented by residual funnel plots.\u003c/jats:p\u003e\u003c/jats:list-item\u003e\n\n\u003cjats:list-item\u003e\u003cjats:p\u003eOverall, we provide ecologists and evolutionary biologists with practical recommendations on which methods are appropriate to employ given independent and non‐independent effect sizes.

However, ecologists and evolutionary biologists often interpret overall mean effects (mean population effects) as consistent across contexts, either explicitly or implicitly, without properly quantifying and interpreting heterogeneity.\u003c/jats:p\u003e\u003c/jats:list-item\u003e\n\n\u003cjats:list-item\u003e\u003cjats:p\u003eHere, we present a pluralistic approach that aims to quantify heterogeneity by introducing complementary metrics, each of which decomposes heterogeneity into within‐study, between‐study and between‐species (species and phylogenetic) variances.

We show that total heterogeneity (variance of true effects) is, on average, 10 times larger than statistical noise (sampling error variance), contributing to 91% of the observed variance (median \u003cjats:italic\u003eI\u003c/jats:italic\u003e\u003cjats:sup\u003e\u003cjats:italic\u003e2\u003c/jats:italic\u003e\u003c/jats:sup\u003e = 91%). This amount of heterogeneity is nearly twice the size of the mean population effect (median \u003cjats:italic\u003eCVH\u003c/jats:italic\u003e = 1.8 and \u003cjats:italic\u003eM\u003c/jats:italic\u003e = 0.6), indicating substantial variation among studies within a meta‐analysis. Moreover, different effect size types yield different values of heterogeneity metrics because they are inherently influenced by statistical properties of their effect size estimators. As such, comparisons of heterogeneity across effect size types should be made with caution, albeit the proposed heterogeneity metrics are unit‐free.\u003c/jats:p\u003e\u003c/jats:list-item\u003e\n\n\u003cjats:list-item\u003e\u003cjats:p\u003eOur large‐scale synthesis also provides new benchmarks for the interpretation of heterogeneity and recommendations on how to quantify and report heterogeneity.

    "abstract": "\u003cjats:title\u003eAbstract\u003c/jats:title\u003e\u003cjats:p\u003eNull hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is the dominant statistical approach in biology, although it has many, frequently unappreciated, problems. Most importantly, NHST does not provide us with two crucial pieces of information: (1) the magnitude of an effect of interest, and (2) the precision of the estimate of the magnitude of that effect. All biologists should be ultimately interested in biological importance, which may be assessed using the magnitude of an effect, but not its statistical significance. Therefore, we advocate presentation of measures of the magnitude of effects (i.e. effect size statistics) and their confidence intervals (CIs) in all biological journals. Combined use of an effect size and its CIs enables one to assess the relationships within data more effectively than the use of\u003cjats:italic\u003ep\u003c/jats:italic\u003evalues, regardless of statistical significance. In addition, routine presentation of effect sizes will encourage researchers to view their results in the context of previous research and facilitate the incorporation of results into future meta‐analysis, which has been increasingly used as the standard method of quantitative review in biology. In this article, we extensively discuss two dimensionless (and thus standardised) classes of effect size statistics:\u003cjats:italic\u003ed\u003c/jats:italic\u003estatistics (standardised mean difference) and\u003cjats:italic\u003er\u003c/jats:italic\u003estatistics (correlation coefficient), because these can be calculated from almost all study designs and also because their calculations are essential for meta‐analysis. However, our focus on these standardised effect size statistics does not mean unstandardised effect size statistics (e.g. mean difference and regression coefficient) are less important. We provide potential solutions for four main technical problems researchers may encounter when calculating effect size and CIs: (1) when covariates exist, (2) when bias in estimating effect size is possible, (3) when data have non‐normal error structure and/or variances, and (4) when data are non‐independent. Although interpretations of effect sizes are often difficult, we provide some pointers to help researchers. This paper serves both as a beginner’s instruction manual and a stimulus for changing statistical practice for the better in the biological sciences.\u003c/jats:p\u003e"

The effects of plant volatiles on parasitoids have been well characterised at small spatial scales, but little research has been done on their effects at larger spatial scales. The spatial matrix of volatiles (‘volatile mosaic’) within which parasitoids locate their hosts is dynamic and heterogeneous. It is shaped by the spatial pattern of HIPV‐emitting plants, the concentration, chemical composition and breakdown of the emitted HIPV blends, and by environmental factors such as wind, turbulence and vegetation that affect transport and mixing of odour plumes. The volatile mosaic may be exploited differentially by different parasitoid species, in relation to species traits such as sensory ability to perceive volatiles and the physical ability to move towards the source. Understanding how HIPVs influence parasitoids at larger spatial scales is crucial for our understanding of tritrophic interactions and sustainable pest management in agriculture. However, there is a large gap in our knowledge on how volatiles influence the process of host location by parasitoids at the landscape scale. Future studies should bridge the gap between the chemical and behavioural ecology of tritrophic interactions and landscape ecology.\u003c/jats:p\u003e"
