The idea is to input a list of papers and get their refernces right using a specific format.

The program needs information about each of those studies. Zotero and others use files like BibTex. Then format them using Citation Style Language (CSL)

The problem with Zotero, Mendeley, etc. is that they add some weird things to the document and make it slow.

The idea is to have something simpler, from the CLI, and in plain text. Then format manually, is not that hard.

How to get all the data for the papers?
Can use CrossRef and get information based ona list of titles or DOIs. Then the problem is how to use that data to get the references right.

## Use only Citation Style Language

Other option is to use Citation Style Language to just import the citations style for each journal.
You can search the journal in:

https://www.zotero.org/styles

https://github.com/zepinglee/citeproc-lua 
https://github.com/citeproc-py/citeproc-py

This may work, but need to test it. For example, try to format in the Journal of Ecology style.

## Create a small language

Another way is to use a simple language to define the format of the cites.

%A    authors. The last one separated with '&'.
%A10  only first ten authors
%Y    year
%T    title
%J    journal name
%j    abbreviated journal name
%V    volumen
%I    issue
%P    pages
%D    DOI
%U    URL

For example:
%A.(%Y).%T.%V(%I)%P.%D 

This has a problem with books. They have another format.
